          Greetings, my name is Marc Frankfurter, and I am a highly motivated
          front-end developer and designer with a passion for technology. My
          fascination with computers and their inner workings began at a young
          age, and by the age of 12, I was already delving into programming,
          creating new characters and abilities for a favorite computer game.
        </p>
        <p class="opacity-80">
          After completing my academic journey with a degree in computer
          engineering from Ulm, I decided to specialize in usability engineering
          and UI development. My first post-graduation role was as a UX
          designer, where I was able to refine my design skills and gain
          valuable experience. However, my love for the technical aspects of
          development eventually led me to transition into a development-focused
          role.
        </p>
        <p class="opacity-80">
          I am an avid tinkerer and enjoy engaging in conversations with my team
          on a wide range of technical topics. Watching a system come together
          and witnessing the seamless integration of individual parts is one of
          the most beautiful aspects of both programming and designing.
        </p>
